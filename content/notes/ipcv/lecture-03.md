## Image Histogram

An **image histogram** is a fundamental tool used for analyzing and manipulating digital images. It provides a graphical representation of the distribution of pixel intensity values.

---

### Definitions

-   **Image Size (M, N)**:  
    An image is a grid of pixels with `M` rows (height) and `N` columns (width).

    -   Total number of pixels: `M × N`

-   **Grey Values (`r_k`, `L`)**:  
    Brightness is quantized into discrete levels.

    -   `L`: Number of grey levels (e.g., `L = 256` for 8-bit images)
    -   `r_k`: A grey level, where `r_0 = 0` (black), `r_{L-1} = 255` (white)

-   **Pixel Count (`n_k`)**:  
    The number of pixels in the image having grey level `r_k`.

    -   For example, `n_0` is the count of pixels with intensity 0.

-   **Unnormalized Histogram `h(r_k)`**:  
    The raw count of pixels for each grey level.  
    `h(r_k) = n_k`

    -   Depends on image size
    -   Not suitable for comparison across different image sizes

-   **Histogram Bins**:  
    Each grey level `r_k` is treated as a bin. The histogram distributes pixel values into these `L` bins.

-   **Normalized Histogram `p(r_k)`**:  
    The probability distribution of grey levels across the image:  
    `p(r_k) = n_k / (M × N)`
    -   Values lie in `[0, 1]`
    -   Independent of image size
    -   The sum of all `p(r_k)` is 1

---

### Numerical Example

A 4×4 grayscale image with \( L = 8 \) grey levels:

```
[ 2, 3, 3, 4 ]
[ 1, 2, 4, 5 ]
[ 0, 1, 5, 6 ]
[ 1, 2, 6, 7 ]
```

-   Rows: `M = 4`
-   Columns: `N = 4`
-   Total pixels: `M × N = 16`
-   Grey levels: `r_k ∈ {0, 1, ..., 7}`

#### Step 2: Unnormalized Histogram

| \( r_k \) | \( n_k \) |
| --------- | --------- |
| 0         | 1         |
| 1         | 3         |
| 2         | 3         |
| 3         | 2         |
| 4         | 2         |
| 5         | 2         |
| 6         | 2         |
| 7         | 1         |
| **Total** | **16**    |

#### Step 3: Normalized Histogram `p(r_k) = n_k / 16`

| Grey Value `r_k` | Count `n_k` | Normalized `p(r_k)` |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| 0                | 1           | `1/16 = 0.0625`     |
| 1                | 3           | `3/16 = 0.1875`     |
| 2                | 3           | `3/16 = 0.1875`     |
| 3                | 2           | `2/16 = 0.125`      |
| 4                | 2           | `2/16 = 0.125`      |
| 5                | 2           | `2/16 = 0.125`      |
| 6                | 2           | `2/16 = 0.125`      |
| 7                | 1           | `1/16 = 0.0625`     |
| **Total**        | **16**      | **1.0**             |

## Histogram Equalization

The goal of histogram equalization is to find a transformation function s = T(r) that takes an input image with any kind of histogram and produces an output image whose histogram is perfectly flat (uniform).

We treat intensity values `r ∈ [0, L−1]` as continuous variables, and define a transformation:

```
s = T(r)
```

---

### Key Requirement

-   `T(r)` must be **monotonically increasing** to preserve intensity ordering.
-   **Strict monotonicity** ensures a one-to-one mapping from input to output values.

---

### Transformation Function

$$
s = T(r) = (L − 1) ∫₀ʳ p_r(α) dα
$$

Where:

-   `p_r(r)` is the **probability density function (PDF)** of the original image (i.e., the normalized histogram).
-   The integral accumulates the probability from 0 to `r`, which is the **cumulative distribution function (CDF)**.
-   The output `s` lies within `[0, L−1]`.

![alt text](/notes/ipcv/images/image15.png)

---

### Result

After applying the transformation `T(r)`, the new intensity distribution `p_s(s)` becomes uniform:

```
p_s(s) = 1    for 0 ≤ s ≤ L − 1
```

This implies that the histogram of the output image is flattened (equalized), leading to enhanced contrast.

p_r(r) is the histogram (or PDF) of the original image with intensities r.

p_s(s) is the histogram (or PDF) of the new, transformed image with intensities s.

---

### Inverse Transformation

In some formulations, we apply the inverse transformation:

```
r = T⁻¹(s)    for 0 ≤ s ≤ L − 1
```

To ensure this works properly, we modify the conditions:

-   `T(r)` must be a **strictly monotonic increasing function** in the interval `0 ≤ r ≤ L − 1`

---

### Monotonic vs. Strictly Monotonic Transformations

-   `T(r)` is **monotonic increasing**, meaning:
    ```
    T(r₂) ≥ T(r₁) for r₂ > r₁
    ```
-   However, multiple input values may map to a single output value (i.e., many-to-one mapping).
-   This is acceptable for forward mapping (`r → s`) but problematic for **inverse mapping**, as not all output values `s` can uniquely determine their input `r`.

By requiring that `T(r)` be **strictly monotonic**:

-   Strict monotonicity:
    ```
    T(r₂) > T(r₁) for r₂ > r₁
    ```
-   Guarantees a **one-to-one mapping** both forward and backward (`r ↔ s`).

---

Let:

-   `r` and `s` be random variables representing input and output intensity values.
-   `p_r(r)` and `p_s(s)` be the **probability density functions (PDFs)** for `r` and `s`.

If:

-   `T(r)` is continuous and differentiable,
-   and we know `p_r(r)` and `T(r)`,

Then the output PDF `p_s(s)` is given by:

$$
p_s(s) = p_r(r) * (dr/ds)
$$

---

Deriving `p_s(s)` from `p_r(r)`

Using Leibniz's Rule:

```
ds/dr = dT(r)/dr = (L − 1) * p_r(r)
```

Therefore:

```
dr/ds = 1 / [(L − 1) * p_r(r)]
```

```
Substitute into
p_s(s) = p_r(r) * (dr/ds)
```

## Spatial Filtering

Spatial filtering involves modifying an image by applying a function to the neighborhood of each pixel. The process replaces each pixel’s value with a new value computed from its surroundings.

The term _filter_ originates from frequency domain processing, where filtering refers to the process of **passing, modifying, or suppressing** specific frequency components within an image. For instance:

-   A **lowpass filter** allows low-frequency components to pass while attenuating high frequencies.
-   The visual result of applying a lowpass filter is image **smoothing**, commonly perceived as **blurring**.

Although frequency domain techniques are a powerful tool for image processing, similar effects—such as smoothing—can also be achieved directly in the **spatial domain** using spatial filters.

The key idea is to apply a kernel (or mask) over the image, processing each pixel in context with its neighborhood to achieve the desired transformation—such as enhancement, noise reduction, or edge detection.

---

## Linear Spatial Filtering

A **linear spatial filter** operates by performing a **sum-of-products** between an image `f(x, y)` and a **filter kernel** `w(s, t)`. The kernel—also referred to as a _mask_, _template_, or _window_—is a small matrix that defines both:

-   The **neighborhood** over which the filtering is applied, and
-   The **coefficients** that determine the nature of the filtering operation (e.g., smoothing, sharpening).

---

### Basic Operation

The mechanics of linear spatial filtering are illustrated using a `3 × 3` kernel. For any pixel at location `(x, y)` in the input image, the filtered response `g(x, y)` is given by the **sum of products** between the kernel coefficients and the corresponding pixels in the neighborhood:

```
g(x, y) =
    w(-1, -1)·f(x-1, y-1) + w(-1, 0)·f(x-1, y) + w(-1, 1)·f(x-1, y+1) +
    w( 0, -1)·f(x,   y-1) + w( 0, 0)·f(x,   y) + w( 0, 1)·f(x,   y+1) +
    w( 1, -1)·f(x+1, y-1) + w( 1, 0)·f(x+1, y) + w( 1, 1)·f(x+1, y+1)
```

This represents a typical convolution-like filtering operation.

---

### General Form

To generalize for a kernel of size `m × n`, where `m = 2a + 1` and `n = 2b + 1` (ensuring odd dimensions), the linear filtering operation is expressed as:

$$
g(x, y) = Σ_{s=-a}^{a} Σ_{t=-b}^{b} w(s, t) · f(x + s, y + t)
$$

This defines the **linear filtering** process over the entire image.

-   `f(x + s, y + t)` are the neighboring pixels of the input image,
-   `w(s, t)` are the kernel weights, and
-   `g(x, y)` is the corresponding output pixel in the filtered image.

As the coordinates `(x, y)` are varied across the image, the kernel slides across each pixel location, computing a new filtered value at every position.

The use of **odd-sized kernels** ensures a well-defined center.

---

## Spatial Correlation and Convolution

**Spatial correlation** and **spatial convolution** are fundamental operations in image processing, both involving a systematic shift of a kernel across an image and computing a **sum-of-products** at each location. These two operations are nearly identical in execution, with one key difference: **convolution requires a 180° rotation of the kernel** before the computation.

This distinction becomes meaningful when the kernel is **not symmetric** about its center. If the kernel is symmetric, both correlation and convolution yield identical results.

---

### Step-by-Step Correlation (1D Example)

$$
g(x) = Σ_{s = -a}^{a} w(s) · f(x + s)
$$

To compute correlation:

1. **Initial Position (x = 0):**  
   Align the center of the kernel with the first position of the input.  
   Compute the first value:

    $$
    g(0) = Σ_{s = -2}^{2} w(s) · f(s)
    $$

2. **Shift Right (x = 1):**  
   Shift the kernel one position to the right and repeat the sum-of-products.

    $$
    g(1) = Σ_{s = -2}^{2} w(s) · f(1 + s)
    $$

3. **Continue Sliding:**  
   Repeat this process by incrementing `x` step by step until the kernel has fully passed over the input signal.

The result is a new signal `g(x)`, where each value represents the correlation output at position `x`.

---

### Full vs. Standard Correlation

-   The **standard correlation** result is generated by starting with the center of the kernel aligned with the image origin and stopping when the kernel’s center passes the last pixel.
-   **Full correlation** extends this by allowing **every kernel element** to interact with every image element, requiring **zero-padding** at the boundaries.

Cropping the full correlation result gives the standard correlation output.

---

![alt text](/notes/ipcv/images/image18.png)

1. **Displacement-Dependent Output:**  
   Correlation values vary based on how far the kernel is displaced from the origin. Each shift by one unit results in a new correlation value.

2. **Response to Unit Impulse:**  
   If `f(x)` is a **discrete unit impulse** (i.e., a sequence of all zeros with a single one), then the correlation result is a **180° rotated** copy of the kernel.  
   This illustrates that correlation introduces reversal when applied to an impulse.

---

### Convolution

In **convolution**, the only difference is that the kernel is **pre-rotated by 180°** before applying the same sliding sum-of-products procedure. This pre-rotation ensures that:

-   Convolution with a unit impulse yields a **direct (non-rotated) copy** of the kernel.
-   Convolution of a function with an impulse copies the function to the location
    of the impulse
-   This is a foundational result in linear system
    theory.

Mathematically, convolution in 1D is represented as:

$$
g(x) = Σ_{s = -a}^{a} w(-s) · f(x + s)
$$

This equation introduces a **mirroring** of the kernel

---

### Correlation and Convolution to 2D Images

### Padding and Kernel Placement

The concepts of 1D spatial correlation and convolution extend naturally to 2D image processing. When applying a 2D kernel of size `m × n` to an image, it is necessary to pad the image boundaries with zeros to allow the kernel to operate on edge pixels.

-   The image is padded with:
    -   `(m - 1) / 2` rows of zeros at the **top and bottom**, and
    -   `(n - 1) / 2` columns of zeros on the **left and right**.

For example, if the kernel size is `3 × 3`, one row and one column of zeros are added on each side

![alt text](/notes/ipcv/images/image19.png)

---

### Correlation on 2D Images

![alt text](/notes/ipcv/images/image20.png)

After the kernel has visited every pixel (with its center aligned), the final output is the correlated image. As in the 1D case, the result at the position of a unit impulse is a **180° rotated copy** of the kernel.

---

### Convolution on 2D Images

![alt text](/notes/ipcv/images/image21.png)

The result of convolving a kernel with an impulse is a **direct (non-rotated) copy** of the kernel centered at the impulse location.

This behavior reflects a fundamental principle in linear system theory: **convolution of a function with a unit impulse produces a copy of that function**, shifted to the impulse's location.

---

> Correlation and convolution yield the **same result** when the kernel is **symmetric** about its center (i.e., `w(i, j) = w(-i, -j)` for all `i`, `j`).

---

### The Discrete Impulse Function

A **discrete impulse** of strength (or amplitude) `A` located at coordinates `(x₀, y₀)` is defined as:

```
δ(x, y) = {
    A,  if x = x₀ and y = y₀
    0,  otherwise
}
```

-   In the **1D example** from Figure 3.29(a), the impulse is represented as `δ(x - 3)`.
-   In the **2D example** from Figure 3.30(a), the impulse is located at `(2, 2)`, relative to an origin at `(0, 0)` and is written as `δ(x - 2, y - 2)`.

Every complex image can be broken down into a sum of impulses. Since filters respond predictably to impulses, we can understand how the filter will behave on the entire image by knowing its response to impulses.

A discrete image can be expressed as:

$$
f(x, y) = ∑₍ᵢ₎ ∑₍ⱼ₎ f(i, j) · δ(x − i, y − j)
$$

Where:

-   `f(x, y)`: The image function at position `(x, y)`
-   `f(i, j)`: The pixel value at coordinates `(i, j)`
-   `δ(x − i, y − j)`: The **2D discrete unit impulse** centered at `(i, j)`
-   The summation runs over all valid pixel coordinates `(i, j)` in the image domain

Convolving any image f with an impulse δ gives you the original image f back, unchanged. The impulse is to convolution what the number 1 is to multiplication.

    f * δ = f

A 5x5 impulse at position (2, 2) would look like this:

```
[ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, 1, 0, 0 ]  <-- The single '1' at (2,2)
[ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]
```


---

### Spatial Correlation

The **correlation** of a kernel `w` of size `m × n` with an image `f(x, y)`, denoted as `(w ⊗ f)(x, y)`, is given by:

$$
(w ⊗ f)(x, y) = ∑_{s = -a}^{a} ∑_{t = -b}^{b} w(s, t) · f(x + s, y + t)
$$

This expression computes the **sum of products** between the kernel coefficients and the image values centered at `(x, y)`. The process slides the kernel over the entire image, computing this value at every location.

> Because our kernels do not depend on `(x, y)`, the notation is often simplified to just `w ⊗ f(x, y)`.

To ensure proper operation at image boundaries, the image `f` is assumed to be **padded appropriately** (typically with zeros).

Assuming the kernel dimensions `m` and `n` are **odd integers**, we define:

-   `a = (m - 1) / 2`
-   `b = (n - 1) / 2`

These values represent the number of rows/columns that extend from the center of the kernel in each direction.

---

### Spatial Convolution

The **convolution** of the same kernel `w` with image `f(x, y)`, denoted as `(w * f)(x, y)`, is defined as:

$$
(w * f)(x, y) = ∑_{s = -a}^{a} ∑_{t = -b}^{b} w(s, t) · f(x - s, y - t)
$$

Here, the kernel is **reflected (rotated by 180°)** before performing the same sliding sum-of-products operation. This is achieved mathematically by using the subtraction inside the function arguments `f(x - s, y - t)`.

> These minus signs align the coordinates of `f` and `w` when one of the functions is rotated 180°

> > > **Linear spatial filtering** and **spatial convolution** are synonymous in this context.

Because **convolution is commutative**, it is **immaterial whether `w` or `f` is rotated**. However, by **convention**, the kernel `w` is the one that is rotated prior to performing the convolution operation.

---

## Full Correlation and Convolution Coverage

To ensure that **every element of a kernel `w` visits every pixel** in an image `f`, not just its center, the definitions of correlation and convolution can be extended. This requires a **modified starting and ending alignment** of the kernel with respect to the image.

-   **Starting alignment**: The **bottom-right corner** of the kernel coincides with the **origin** of the image.
-   **Ending alignment**: The **top-left corner** of the kernel coincides with the **bottom-right** corner of the image.

### Padding Requirements

Let:

-   `w` be of size `m × n`
-   `f` be of size `M × N`

To support full kernel traversal, the image must be padded with:

-   `(m - 1)` rows: top and bottom
-   `(n - 1)` columns: left and right

### Resulting Output Size

With this extended padding, the **full correlation or convolution output** will have dimensions:

```text
S_v = M + m - 1
S_h = N + n - 1
```

Thus, the output array will be of size:

```text
S_v × S_h
```

---

> Unlike convolution, **correlation is neither commutative nor associative**.

| Property         | Convolution (`*`)                 | Correlation (`⨂`)                          |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Commutative**  | `f * g = g * f`                   | Not generally commutative: `f ⨂ g ≠ g ⨂ f` |
| **Associative**  | `(f * g) * h = f * (g * h)`       | Not generally associative                  |
| **Distributive** | `f * (g + h) = (f * g) + (f * h)` | `f ⨂ (g + h) = (f ⨂ g) + (f ⨂ h)`          |

---

## Multistage Convolution Filtering

In certain applications, an image is **filtered sequentially** in multiple stages, where each stage uses a **distinct convolution kernel**.

For example, let:

-   `f` be the input image
-   `w₁, w₂, ..., w_Q` be a sequence of kernels applied in `Q` stages

Then the image is processed as follows:

```text
Stage 1:      f₁ = w₁ * f
Stage 2:      f₂ = w₂ * f₁
Stage 3:      f₃ = w₃ * f₂
...
Stage Q:      f_Q = w_Q * f_{Q-1}
```

However, due to the **commutative and associative properties** of convolution, this entire process can be replaced by a **single convolution**:

```text
f_Q = w * f
```

Where:

```text
w = w₁ * w₂ * w₃ * ... * w_Q
```

---

## Resulting Kernel Size

Let each kernel `wₖ` have size `m × n` for all `k ∈ [1, Q]`. Then, the combined kernel `w` will have dimensions `W_v × W_h`, computed as:

Each additional convolution increases the total size by  
\( m - 1 \) in rows and \( n - 1 \) in columns:

So:

$$
W_v = m + (Q - 1)(m - 1) = Q(m - 1) + 1 \cdot m = Q(m - 1) + m
$$

```text
W_v = Q × (m - 1)
W_h = Q × (n - 1)
```

These expressions result from the recursive application of the full convolution dimension formulas:

```text
S_v = M + m - 1
S_h = N + n - 1
```

These assume that **each value of the kernel** fully visits the result of the previous convolution stage, using **full padding** and **complete alignment**.

## Separable Spatial Filters

A 2D function `G(x, y)` is said to be **separable** if it can be written as the product of two 1D functions:

```text
G(x, y) = G₁(x) · G₂(y)
```

In image processing, a **spatial filter kernel** is represented as a matrix. A kernel is said to be **separable** if it can be expressed as the **outer product** of two vectors.

### Example: Separable Kernel

Consider the following `2 × 3` kernel:

```text
w = [1 1 1
     1 1 1]
```

This kernel is separable because it can be expressed as:

![alt text](/notes/ipcv/images/image26.png)

Thus, `w` is the outer product `c · rᵀ`.

---

For a separable kernel `w` of size `m × n`, it can be written as:

```text
w = v · wᵀ                    
```

Where:

- `v` is a column vector of size `m × 1`
- `w` is a column vector of size `n × 1` (so `wᵀ` is a `1 × n` row vector)

In the special case where the kernel is **square**, i.e., of size `m × m`, we can simplify the notation:

```text
w = v · vᵀ                    
```

The product of a column vector and a row vector yields a matrix. This operation is equivalent to the **2D convolution** of the vectors:

```text
w = v * wᵀ
```

Hence, separable kernels enable **more efficient filtering** by decomposing a 2D convolution into **two 1D convolutions**, one along rows and one along columns, significantly reducing computational complexity.

## Computational Advantages of Separable Kernels

The primary benefit of using **separable kernels** lies in the computational efficiency gained through the **associative property** of convolution.

Suppose we have a kernel `w` that can be decomposed into two simpler kernels, `w₁` and `w₂`, such that:

```text
w = w₁ * w₂
```

Then, due to the **commutative** and **associative** properties of convolution (see Table 3.5), it follows that:

```text
w * f = (w₁ * w₂) * f = w₁ * (w₂ * f) = w₂ * (w₁ * f)
```

Let:

- `f` be an image of size `M × N`
- `w` be a filter kernel of size `m × n`

 
`For Non-Separable Case` convolving `w` with `f` requires approximately:

```text
O(M · N · m · n)
```

multiplication and addition operations. This is because every output pixel is influenced by all coefficients in the kernel.

`For Separable Case` 

If `w` is separable into `w₁` (`m × 1`) and `w₂` (`1 × n`), then:

1. The first convolution, `w₁ * f`, requires `O(M · N · m)` operations.
2. The second convolution, `w₂ * (w₁ * f)`, also produces an image of size `M × N` and requires `O(M · N · n)` operations.

Thus, the **total operations** become:

```text
O(M · N · (m + n))
```

The **computational advantage** of using a separable kernel versus a non-separable kernel is given by:

```text
C = (M · N · m · n) / (M · N · (m + n)) = (m · n) / (m + n)      
```

For example, a kernel of size `11 × 11` yields:

```text
C = (11 × 11) / (11 + 11) = 121 / 22 ≈ 5.5
```

This means filtering can be over five times faster. For large kernels (hundreds of elements), speedups can reach a factor of **100 or more**, significantly improving execution time.

---

## Determining Kernel Separability

From **matrix theory**, any matrix formed by the outer product of a **column vector** and a **row vector** has **rank 1**. Since separable kernels are defined in this way, we can determine separability by checking if the kernel matrix has rank 1.

>The rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns in the matrix

If `rank(w) == 1`, then `w` is separable.

### Extracting 1D Kernels from a Separable Kernel

To decompose a rank-1 kernel `w` into its constituent 1D vectors `v` and `wᵀ`, follow these steps:

1. **Identify a non-zero element** in the kernel and denote it as `E`.
2. Extract the **column** and **row** that contain this element. Denote them:
   - `c` = column vector
   - `r` = row vector
3. Use the following relationships:

```text
v = c
wᵀ = r / E
```

Thus:

```text
w = v · wᵀ
```

This decomposition works because all rows and columns in a rank-1 matrix are **linearly dependent**—they differ only by scalar multiples.

### Special Case: Circularly Symmetric Kernels

For **circularly symmetric** kernels (e.g., Gaussian), the kernel can be described completely by the **central column vector**. In such cases:

```text
w = v · vᵀ / c
```

Where:
- `v` is the central column vector,
- `c` is the value at the center of the kernel.

Then the 1D components used for convolution become:

```text
w₁ = v
w₂ = vᵀ / c
```

This allows implementation of the 2D filter using two 1D convolutions, one horizontal and one vertical, maintaining both efficiency and accuracy.

### Example: Decomposing a Rank-1 Kernel into the Outer Product of Two Vectors

### 🔷 Given 2D Kernel `w`

Suppose we are given the following `3 × 3` kernel:

```
w =
[  2   4   6
   4   8  12
   6  12  18 ]
```

### 🔷 Step 1: Pick a Non-Zero Entry

Let’s choose the element at position `(0, 0)`:

```
E = w[0][0] = 2
```

---

### 🔷 Step 2: Extract the Column and Row

**Column vector** `c` (first column):

```
v = [ 2
      4
      6 ]
```

**Row vector** `r` (first row):

```
r = [ 2  4  6 ]
```

---

### 🔷 Step 3: Normalize the Row Vector

To construct the outer product:

```
v = c
wᵀ = r / E = [ 2/2  4/2  6/2 ] = [ 1  2  3 ]
```

---

### 🔷 Final Result

We now have:

```
v   = [ 2
         4
         6 ]

wᵀ = [ 1  2  3 ]
```

Taking the outer product:

```
w = v · wᵀ =
    [ 2×1  2×2  2×3 ]   → [  2   4   6
      4×1  4×2  4×3 ]      4   8  12
      6×1  6×2  6×3 ]      6  12  18 ]
```

`w` is separable and equal to the outer product of `v` and `wᵀ`.

### Example: Decomposition of a Circularly Symmetric Kernel into Separable 1D Components

```
w = (v · vᵀ) / c
```

### 🔷 Step 1: Define a Circularly Symmetric Kernel

Consider the following 3×3 Gaussian-like kernel:

```
w =
[ 1  2  1
  2  4  2
  1  2  1 ]
```

This kernel is **circularly symmetric**, as its values are symmetric about the center and decrease radially.

- Center value: `c = 4`
- Central column vector `v` (middle column):

```
v = [ 2
      4
      2 ]
```

---

### 🔷 Step 2: Outer Product of `v` with Itself

Compute the outer product:

```
v · vᵀ =
[ 2     ]   ·   [ 2  4  2 ] =
[ 4     ]
[ 2     ]

Result:
[  4   8   4
   8  16   8
   4   8   4 ]
```

---

### 🔷 Step 3: Normalize by `c = 4`

Divide the entire matrix by `4`:

```
w = (v · vᵀ) / 4 =
[ 1  2  1
  2  4  2
  1  2  1 ]
```
This matches the original kernel.
