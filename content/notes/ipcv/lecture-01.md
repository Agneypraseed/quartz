**Discretization** refers to the process of transforming a continuous domain into a discrete one by representing it with a finite set of elements.  
In the context of images, this typically involves converting a continuous spatial domain `Ω ⊂ ℝ²` (where an image is defined as a continuous function over space) into a finite grid of samples (**pixels**).

### Sampling (Spatial Discretization)

Sampling refers to discretizing the continuous spatial domain `Ω`.  
We choose specific points `(xᵢ, yⱼ)`, turning `f(x, y)` into a grid of values:

```
fᵢⱼ = f(xᵢ, yⱼ)
```

Example:

-   Cameraman image at resolution 256×256 → 256 samples along each axis → 65,536 pixels.
-   Reducing to 64×64 or 32×32 leads to fewer pixels and loss of detail.

### Tonal Domain and Quantization (Intensity Discretization)

The **tonal domain** (also known as the intensity domain or range) refers to the set of all possible intensity or color values a pixel in an image can take.

**Quantization** is the process of discretizing the range of grey levels, mapping the continuous intensity `f(x, y)` to a finite set of values, typically integers.

Common case:

-   **8-bit quantization** → values in `{ 0, 1, ..., 255 }`
    -   `0`: black, `255`: white

**Binary images**:

-   Co-domain: `{ 0, 1 }`, often rescaled to `{ 0, 255 }`
-   Result from thresholding operations, useful in document scanning, object detection, etc.

### Digital Image Formation Summary

#### To convert a continuous image into digital format:

-   Use **Sampling** (for space)
-   Use **Quantization** (for intensity)

**Example pipeline:**

-   **Original grayscale image** → 256×256, 8-bit depth
-   **Downsampling**:
    -   Sample to 64×64 → coarse detail
    -   Sample to 32×32 → fine detail lost; image appears blocky
-   **Quantization/Binarization**:
    -   Apply threshold (e.g., 128)
        -   Pixel ≥ 128 → white (255)
        -   Pixel < 128 → black (0)
-   **Result**: binary image highlighting structure or edges

### Color Images

A color image is defined as a function:

```
f(x, y): Ω → ℝ³
```

#### RGB Color Model

Standard model for display systems (monitors, cameras).  
Each channel is typically 8 bits → values in `[0, 255]` per channel.

Examples:

-   `[255, 0, 0]` → red
-   `[0, 255, 0]` → green
-   `[255, 255, 255]` → white

### HSV Color Space

HSV stands for:

-   **Hue (H):** Color type (e.g., red, green)
-   **Saturation (S):** Color purity/intensity
-   **Value (V):** Brightness

**Advantages**:  
Perceptually uniform – better aligns with how humans perceive color, making it useful in:

-   Object tracking
-   Image segmentation
-   Thresholding in color space

| RGB (R,G,B)     | HSV (H,S,V)               |
| --------------- | ------------------------- |
| [255, 0, 0]     | [0°, 1, 1] (pure red)     |
| [0, 255, 0]     | [120°, 1, 1] (pure green) |
| [0, 0, 255]     | [240°, 1, 1] (pure blue)  |
| [128, 128, 128] | [0°, 0, 0.5] (grey)       |
